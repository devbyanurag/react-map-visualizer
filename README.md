## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **OpenLayers**: For handling mapping functionalities.
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and better development experience.
- **React-Toastify**: For user notifications and feedback.

## Features

- **Interactive Map**: Users can click on the map to add points and draw lines between them.
- **Polygon Creation**: Users can create polygons by adding multiple points and closing the shape.
- **Dynamic UI**: The application includes modals for managing lines and polygons.
- **Data Management**: Users can manage points, lines, and polygons efficiently, including adding, removing, and editing geospatial features.

## Key Components

- **MapView**: Main map component handling OpenLayers integration
- **MissionCreation**: Manages the creation of missions and routes
- **PolygonCreation**: Handles polygon drawing and editing
- **BottomControls**: Contains UI controls for map interaction
